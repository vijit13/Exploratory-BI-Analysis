# Exploratory-BI-Analysis
BI ANALYSIS / SUMMARIZE DATA

1. Project Background and Description

The goal of this project is to use your skills to analyze and explain the attached “consumer purchasing” data-set. Once you

have understood the data-set, your will need to explain your analysis using reports, diagrams, written explanations and/or a

simple application that can summarize your findings. Note: There are two tables (csv) which will require linking via primary key.

2. Project Scope (May require Tableau, Python, iPython, Excel)

The project can be completed using Tableau, Python, iPython Notebook (preferred), Excel or similar. In order to link the two

data-sets (csv’s) you will need to link them using:

purchase_receipt.csv ext_id   purchase_receipt_items.csv receipt_ext_id

3. High-Level Requirements

The final project can include any additional information beyond that listed below, however it must include the below items.

Your project must include the following information on:

 A report/analysis or application that illustrates frequency of purchase

 A report/analysis or application that illustrates most popular items and or stores

 A report/analysis or application that illustrates most popular purchase times

 A report/analysis or application that illustrates an overview of what is occurring based on all data

o Example: More/Less purchases are occurring as a whole

 Optional: Any other deep dive into the data with illustration/report/summary of what you found.

4. Resources

There are two CSV files for this project that will require linking together in some manner to have access to all the data-points.

purchase_receipt.csv - The header/record of purchase with store,dates, etc.

purchase_receipt_items.csv - The item-level showing each item purchased, prices, etc.
